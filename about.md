FluteBot is a educational game that introduces programming concepts to children in the kindergarden! Let the children create songs that helps the sheeps find their way to their food.

This game was developed by Johan Helmertz as part of his Masters Thesis in M.Sc in Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering (LTH) at Lund University. The project was made at Educational Technology Group (http://www.lucs.lu.se/etg/) and supervised by Magnus Haake.
